# TinyTemplate
A tiny templating engine written in PHP.
This small engine is not really meant for 
production environments unless heavily modified 
to fit your business' needs.

## Installation
To install this, please use Composer and import the 
project using the following command: 
`composer require binarmorker/tinytemplate`

## Usage
To learn how to use the engine, please refer to the 
examples contained into the 'test' folder.

This package only contains basic rules to display 
variables and allow loops and conditions. If you 
wish to extend it, you can create more rules and 
load them into the Engine, or if you think some 
rules would be better integrated into the basic 
package, please submit a pull request.
